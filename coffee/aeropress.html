<h2 id="header-1"><span class="section-number">1</span>AeroPress vs AeroPress Go</h2>
<p>Many have already weighed in on comparing the Aeropress to the Aeropress Go.
I don&#39;t think I need to go there. Rather, I&#39;ll describe why I bother keeping both,
and where I would use one over the other.</p>

<h4 id="header-1-1-1"><span class="section-number">1.1.1</span>Less than 80g coffee needed</h4>
<p>To me, the AeroPress Go is the clear winner in this scenario.</p>
<p>Pregrind the coffee right before the trip, put it in a ziplock and stuff it into the shaft
of the plunger. Leave the stirrer and scoop at home. Everything you need packs into the
serving container. As long as you have a way to heat water, this setup is about as simple
as it gets.</p>
<p>The Hoffmann technique uses about an 18/1 ratio. This makes enough for seven
200ml servings. Only you can be the judge of how long this will last.</p>
<p>On a recent overnight with my wife, I packed 33g of ground coffee and used a
variation of the Hoffmann technique to brew a concentrate. This was then diluted
after the brew to make two cups.</p>
<p>If I need more than 80g, it&#39;s likely I&#39;ll need a grinder. If that&#39;s the case, then
the AeroPress Go loses some appeal, as it&#39;s no longer a self-contained coffee kit.</p>
<h4 id="header-1-1-2"><span class="section-number">1.1.2</span>Car Camping</h4>
<p>To me, car camping is about enjoying the outdoors in comfort. The only restriction
I place on coffee tools is that they don&#39;t require electricity.</p>
<p>If I&#39;m with a group, I&#39;m going to bring some fun tools and share. There will be
pourovers, french press, moka pot, flair signature, a few different roasts...
we will nerd-out on some coffee.</p>
<p>The exception to this is if I&#39;m just doing an overnight.</p>
<h4 id="header-1-1-3"><span class="section-number">1.1.3</span>Backpacking</h4>
<p>Honestly, this is something I haven&#39;t done in a while. My wife &#38; kids have zero interest
in roughing it, so I have to plan it out if I&#39;m going to ditch them and explore the great
outdoors. With that pointless explanation out of the way, here&#39;s what I <i>would</i> do now that I
am a coffee snob.</p>
<p>I think the AeroPress Go makes sense here. A grinder, I&#39;m not so sure. If I wanted to shave
off the extra pound, I might just take instant. I have some Mount Hagen- It&#39;s actually decent.
Finally, if I was ok with skipping a wam cup, I could take 100mg caffiene pills. Not as
enjoyable, but could take out the need to heat water in the AM while treating caffiene withdrawl
symptoms.</p>
<h3 id="header-1-2"><span class="section-number">1.2</span>Technique</h3>
I&#39;m a fan of James Hoffmann&#39;s <a href="https://youtu.be/j6VlT_jUVPc">Ultimate AeroPress technique</a>. It&#39;s simple, reducesthe tools you need, produces a great cup, and is a solid base for other brewing recipes.<p>It can also be brewed reliably without a scale. When measuring, observe where the grounds
top off in the shaft, and also where the water lines up against the numbers on the side.</p>
