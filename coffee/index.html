One of those was coffee. In the past, I would grind bulk coffee in the store, and brew it in a drip machine. This was fine before. Now I am ruined.</p>
<h2 id="beans">Beans</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve found that I really enjoy a light to medium roast Columbian. Also some from Ethiopia and Brazil.</p>
<p>To aquire the beans, I&#39;m using Bottomless. It&#39;s a SaaS that sends you an internet-connected scale that you set your coffee on. When it gets low, they order you more. It&#39;s roast-to-order, and I&#39;ve been enjoying lots of great coffee. I indicate favorite orders, and it tailors the next order based on that. And to complete this little ad, here&#39;s an invite link that gives us both a free bag: <a href="https://www.bottomless.com/referral/JPost1218">https://www.bottomless.com/referral/JPost1218</a></p>
<h2 id="brew">Brew</h2>
<p>My typical morning brew is with a Hario V60. Per cup, about 15g coffee and 250g water. I&#39;m using James Hoffmann&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI4ynXzkSQo">Ultimate V60 technique</a>.</p>
<p>For my wife&#39;s cup, I top it off with frothed milk and either cinnamon or finely-chopped chocolate.</p>
<p>I also experiment with making espresso using a <a href="https://flairespresso.com/products/espresso-makers/flair-signature/">Flair Signature</a>. It works great in a car camping scenario.</p>
<p>For cold brew, I&#39;ve been experimenting with using an AeroPress to filter the beans after brewing. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s removing some oils, but I&#39;ve been happy with how clean the end result is.</p>
<p>The Aeropress Go is still a great option for just myself. I haven&#39;t been travelling much this past year, so it gets less use. Thanks again to James Hoffmann for his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6VlT_jUVPc">Ultimate AeroPress Technique</a>. I have tried all sorts of crazy stuff in the past, but his technique is simple and reliable.</p>
