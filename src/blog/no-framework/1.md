## The No Framework SPA Tutorial, part 1

I think JavaScript developers are nuts.

It's ok, I'm one of them and I'm nuts too. But I want to show you something that I think is less nuts. Working without a framework or ay third party libraries. Some folks
don't even realize how realistic of an option that is.

If you are a javascript developer and you have never built an SPA without a framework,
I highly recommend it. In the process of building one, you will have implemented a lot
of functionality that can be provided by libaries. From there, you can look into massive
number of JavaScript libraries out there and be able to fine-tune the dependencies on
your codebase, instead of some framework CLI prescribing it's preferencen in packages.

No more time to waste, let's get started. We are going to build a page that 
gives us information about countries,
using the very nice [REST Countries][] API. It will end up being around 50 lines of code,
including our [Vanilla JS][] dependency.

First off, you'll need an `index.html` page. Let's fill it with the normal junk:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>List of Countries</title>
</head>
<body></body>
<script>
// Woohoo, I'm ready when you are!
</script>
</html>
```

Looks great, that's all we need to start writing a web app. We'll be doing 
everything in this single file for now. Assume all following JS examples are 
in the `<script>` tag.

Let's write a little boilerplate. It's nice to have a 'main' function that is 
the entrypoint to your application.

```javascript
function main () {
  const title = document.createElement('h2')
  title.innerText = document.title
}

main()
```

Look ma, no React/Vue/Angular/Webpack/Rollup/Gulp/Typescript/Babel/Config! (Yet...)

Let's build a helper function, because we're going to be
creating a lot of elements. 

```javascript
function create(element, text) {
  const el = document.createElement(element)
  el.innerText = text
  return el
}
```

Not a bad start. Let's build a table.

```javascript
const mockData = [
  { fish: 'one' },
  { fish: 'two' },
  { fish: 'red' },
  { fish: 'blue' }
]

function Table (data) {
  const table = create('table')
  const thead = create('thead')
  const tbody = create('tbody')
  const tr = create('tr')
  const columns = Object.keys(data.reduce((a, v) => Object.assign(a, v), {}))
  
  columns.forEach(column => tr.appendChild(create('th', column)))
  thead.appendChild(tr)
  table.appendChild(thead)
  data.forEach(record => {
    const tr = create('tr')
    columns.forEach(column => tr.appendChild('td', record[column]))
    tbody.appendChild(tr)
  }

  return table.appendChild(tbody)
}
```

Let's make it cleaner, and call our `create` function `h` so it can be Ã  _la mode_.

```javascript
function h(element, children) {
  const el = document.createElement(element)
  
  if (arguments[h.length]) {
    for (let i = h.length, j = arguments.length, i < j; i++) {
      const arg = arguments[i]
      if (typeof arg === 'string') {
          el.appendChild(document.createTextNode(arg)
      } else if (arg instanceof HTMLElement) {
        el.appendChild(arg)
      }
    }
  }
  return el
}
```

```javascript
function h(element = 'div', classes, children) {
  const el = document.createElement(element)
  
  if (Array.isArray(classes)) {
    classes.forEach(c => el.classList.add(c))
  } else if (typeof classes === 'string') {
    el.classList.add(classes)
  }
  
  if (Array.isArray(children)) {
    children.forEach(c => {
      if (c instanceof HTMLElement) {
        el.append(c)
      }
    })
  } else if (children instanceof HTMLElement) {
    el.append(children)
  } else if (typeof children === 'string') {
    el.innerText = children
  }

  return el
}
```

This provides functionality comparable to element-creating functions 
in various [libraries][hyperscript] [and][preact] [frameworks][hyperapp]. Let's disect it a bit:

- Calling `h()` just returns an empty `div` element. Other elements can be created like `h('h2')`.
- You can choose to pass in a class as a string, or several classes as an array of strings.
- You can choose to pass in children, which could be an element, an array of elements or some text.

This is pretty powerful stuff. You'll see why we wanted to give the function such a short name:

```javascript
// Nice table ya got there...
h('table', 'table', [ 
  h('thead', null,
    h('tr', null, [
      h('th', null, 'name'),
      h('th', null, 'capital')
    ])
  ),
  h('tbody', null, [
    h('tr', null, [
      h('td', null, 'Belgium'),
      h('td', null, 'Brussels')
    ]),
    h('tr', null, [
      h('td', null, 'Chile'),
      h('td', null, 'Santiago')
    ])
  ])
])
```
