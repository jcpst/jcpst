## The No Framework SPA Tutorial, part 1

JavaScript developers are nuts.

It's ok, I'm one of them and I'm nuts too.

I want to show you something that I think is less nuts. Working without a framework or ay third party libraries. Some folks
don't realize how realistic of an option that is.

If you are a javascript developer and never built an SPA without a framework,
please try it. Afterward, you can explore the massive ecosystem of JavaScript libraries 
and be able to fine-tune the dependencies on your codebase, rather than tuning your thinking
to someone else's framework.

Ok, glad to hear you'll do it!

No more time to waste, let's get started. We are going to build a page that 
gives us information about countries,
using the very nice [REST Countries][] API. It will end up being around 50 lines of code,
including our [Vanilla JS][] dependency.

First off, you'll need an `index.html` page. Let's fill it with the normal junk:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>List of Countries</title>
</head>
<body></body>
<script>
// Woohoo, I'm ready when you are!
</script>
</html>
```

Looks great, that's all we need to start writing a web app. We'll be doing 
everything in this single file for now (Single File App! SFA?). Assume all 
following JS examples are in the `<script>` tag.

Look ma, no React/Vue/Angular/Webpack/Rollup/Gulp/Typescript/Babel/Config! (Yet...)

Let's build a little helper function, because we're going to be
creating a lot of elements. 

```javascript
function create(element, text) {
  const el = document.createElement(element)
  el.innerText = text
  return el
}
```

Not a bad start. Let's build a table.

```javascript
const mockData = [
  { fish: 'one' },
  { fish: 'two' },
  { fish: 'red' },
  { fish: 'blue' }
]

function Table (data) {
  const table = create('table')
  const thead = create('thead')
  const tbody = create('tbody')
  const tr = create('tr')
  const columns = Object.keys(data.reduce((a, v) => Object.assign(a, v), {}))
  
  columns.forEach(column => tr.appendChild(create('th', column)))
  thead.appendChild(tr)
  table.appendChild(thead)
  data.forEach(record => {
    const tr = create('tr')
    columns.forEach(column => tr.appendChild('td', record[column]))
    tbody.appendChild(tr)
  }

  return table.appendChild(tbody)
}
```

Let's make it make our element factory a little more robust, 
and call it `h()` so it can be _Ã  la mode_.

```javascript
function h(element = 'div', classes, children) {
  const el = document.createElement(element)
  
  if (Array.isArray(classes)) {
    classes.forEach(c => el.classList.add(c))
  } else if (typeof classes === 'string') {
    el.classList.add(classes)
  }
  
  if (Array.isArray(children)) {
    children.forEach(c => {
      if (c instanceof HTMLElement) {
        el.append(c)
      }
    })
  } else if (children instanceof HTMLElement) {
    el.append(children)
  } else if (typeof children === 'string') {
    el.innerText = children
  }

  return el
}
```

This provides functionality comparable to element-creating functions 
in various [libraries][hyperscript] [and][preact] [frameworks][hyperapp]. Let's disect it a bit:

- Calling `h()` just returns an empty `div` element. Other elements can be created like `h('h2')`.
- You can choose to pass in a class as a string, or several classes as an array of strings.
- You can choose to pass in children, which could be an element, an array of elements or some text.

This is pretty powerful stuff. YNow we can write a table like this:

```javascript
// Nice table ya got there...
h('table', 'table', [ 
  h('thead', null,
    h('tr', null, [
      h('th', null, 'name'),
      h('th', null, 'capital')
    ])
  ),
  h('tbody', null, [
    h('tr', null, [
      h('td', null, 'Belgium'),
      h('td', null, 'Brussels')
    ]),
    h('tr', null, [
      h('td', null, 'Chile'),
      h('td', null, 'Santiago')
    ])
  ])
])
```

In part 2, we'll fetch data and display it.
