## 2017!!

For most of the time, this site has just been about me. This is fine for
your standard stalker types.

However, being a man of many esoteric tastes, I thought it would be good to make
it more useful for people with similar curiosities.

I'll probably start adding articles about some of the interests listed on
the [about][1] page, and grow the site from there.

I might be writing about alternative guitar tunings, shell scripts I find
useful, recipes I make up, post some stuff on my new band, maybe even my
opinions on our brand new US demagogue.
