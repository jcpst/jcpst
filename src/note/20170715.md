I just finished mixing and mastering my buddy John Clark's latest album, _CiCaDiA_. 

_Joined in lucid dreams by The StickFolk band of bugs, John Clark shares the story of Hoppy and his mystical journey from a midwestern pasture to CiCaDiA, bug heaven._

It's some pretty cool psychedelic folk tunes. Here's a link to his site (which I also did): [deaththerapy.net][]

Check it out if that sounds interesting to you!
