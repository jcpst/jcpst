### About

I'm a composer and programmer in Kansas City.

#### Background / Braggadocio

I picked up a bass guitar in 1996. Then formed bands, cut records, toured the 
US a few times, earned a B.M., wrote music that won awards and featured at 
various national conferences...

After college, I recorded music for seven years, everything from the Avett Bros 
to Gillie Da Kid ([credits](/credits)). I still produce albums for a few select
clients.

I got the programming bug, and these days I'm working on enterprise web apps, 
mostly in the realm of node/javascript and CI/Linux/DevOps stuff.

My interests include analog synthesizers, Arch Linux, craft beer 
(IPAs), cycling, DevOps, erlang, functional programming, guitars, 
just intonation, my family, Node.js, tube amps, vegan cooking, wandering around, 
Zsh...
