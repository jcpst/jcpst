Slightly Longer Version
-----------------------

There were two pieces of electronics I really enjoyed as a child: a tape 
recorder that my mother bought me at a garage sale, and a 'portable' computer 
running DOS.

When I was 11, I picked up my first bass guitar and discovered I was a musician.
Then I formed bands, cut records, toured the US a few times, earned a B.M., 
composed music that won awards and was featured at various national conferences...

After college, I was recording engineer for seven years, everything from the
Avett Bros  to Gillie Da Kid ([credits](/credits)). I still produce albums for
a few select clients.

Because I had always explored all sorts of digital and analog electronics,
getting into exploring software seemed to make sense.

I got the programming bug, and these days I'm working on enterprise web apps, 
mostly in the realm of node/javascript and CI/Linux/DevOps stuff.

This Site
---------

I've always liked the juxtoposition of old and new. I'm a fan of the way
websites looked in the 90s, but we have much better tools now.

This is a statically-generated site using [harp][1]. For templating it uses Jade
(now [pug][2]), css is generated with [stylus][3], and pages are generally
written in [markdown][4]. When I push changes to master, a script runs in
[travis][5] and automatically builds and deploys the changes, which are served
via [github pages][6].
