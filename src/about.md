Hello. I'm a software developer that currently lives in the midwest. I primarily design and build common functionality for the application developers in a global logistics company. I'm married, and have 3 kids and 2 dogs.

This site is for sharing things I have created, or things I've learned. As someone who grew up in the Geocities
era, I find a personal web site much more interesting than a social media feed.

I have obsessions with coffee, camping, audio synthesis, and open source software.

In the past, I worked as a audio recording engineer and composer, but after 7 years never quite made it past "barely scraping by". I still try to find ways to fit that world into my current life.
