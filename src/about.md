Like anyone else, I play many different roles:

_As a software developer_, I currently lead a team at a large corporation, building applications in the logistics industry.

_As a recording engineer_, I've worked with a variety of artists (credits listed [here](/credits)). I don't keep myself booked anymore, but I still do freelance if the project is interesting and I have time.

_As a composer_, I've had my works performed all around the US. I've also formed bands, wrote music for them, recorded them, toured with them.

_As a familyman_, I am happily married with three lovely kiddos.
