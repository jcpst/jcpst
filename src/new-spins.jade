	I wanted to give you a complete list of my Bandcamp purchases in reverse 
	chronological order. Unfortunately, Bandcamp has deprecated their API, so
	I have resorted to using a script 
	(#[a(href='https://github.com/jcpst/jcpst/blob/master/get_latest_records.sh') source]) 
	in my CI build that curls and transforms the response from my Bandcamp profile.
