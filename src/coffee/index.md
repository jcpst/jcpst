Like many people during the COVID-19 pandemic, I started exploring new hobbies. One of those was coffee. In the past, I would grind bulk coffee in the store, and brew it in a drip machine. This was fine before. Now I am ruined.

## Beans

I've found that I really enjoy a light to medium roast Columbian. Also some from Ethiopia and Brazil.

To aquire the beans, I'm using Bottomless. It's a SaaS that sends you an internet-connected scale that you set your coffee on. When it gets low, they order you more. It's roast-to-order, and I've been enjoying lots of great coffee. I indicate favorite orders, and it tailors the next order based on that. And to complete this little ad, here's an invite link that gives us both a free bag: https://www.bottomless.com/referral/JPost1218

## Brew

My typical morning brew is with a Hario V60. Per cup, about 15g coffee and 250g water. I'm using James Hoffmann's [Ultimate V60 technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI4ynXzkSQo).

For my wife's cup, I top it off with frothed milk and either cinnamon or finely-chopped chocolate.

I also experiment with making espresso using a [Flair Signature](https://flairespresso.com/products/espresso-makers/flair-signature/). It works great in a car camping scenario.

For cold brew, I've been experimenting with using an AeroPress to filter the beans after brewing. I'm sure it's removing some oils, but I've been happy with how clean the end result is.

The Aeropress Go is still a great option for just myself. I haven't been travelling much this past year, so it gets less use. Thanks again to James Hoffmann for his [Ultimate AeroPress Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6VlT_jUVPc). I have tried all sorts of crazy stuff in the past, but his technique is simple and reliable.
