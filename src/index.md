Hello, welcome to my home on the web!

I have a practically non-existant social media presence, so if something on here strikes you as interesting, feel free to reach out and share!

_I'm interested in:_

Arch Linux, Audio Synthesis, Baritone Guitars, Bass Guitar, Beer, BSDs, Camping, Cycling, DAWs, Death Metal, Entheogens, Hiking, Just Intonation, Lisps, Nature Conservation, Non-Duality, Rust-lang, Stock Markets, Supercollider, Tube Amps, Veganism, Zsh...

...and a bunch of other things that could be used to create a nice profile for marketers.
