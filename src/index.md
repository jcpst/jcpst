## Intro

Hello. I'm a software developer that currently lives in the midwest. Prior to that,
I worked as a recording engineer. I have 3 kids, 2 dogs, and one wife. 

The goal with this site is to share things I've learned, or things I've created. I have a
distain for modern social media. I'm interested in others that publish their own sites.

## Updates

### 2021-05-16

Things I've been working on since my last update: brewing coffee, experimenting with sampling and sequencing hardware and software.

### 2020-07-29

I wanted to parse `.org` files for this site, so I made a jsTransformer module: [link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jstransformer-org)

### 2020-07-20 

Decided it was time to redo this site. I wanted to see how little styling I could use without my wife thinking the page looks "broken".
