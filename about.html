<p><em>As a software developer</em>, I currently lead a team at a large corporation, building applications in the logistics industry.</p>
<p><em>As a recording engineer</em>, I&#39;ve worked with a variety of artists (credits listed <a href="/credits">here</a>). I don&#39;t keep myself booked anymore, but I still do freelance if the project is interesting and I have time.</p>
<p><em>As a composer</em>, I&#39;ve had my works performed all around the US. I&#39;ve also formed bands, wrote music for them, recorded them, toured with them.</p>
<p><em>As a familyman</em>, I am happily married with three lovely kiddos.</p>
