<p><em>As a software developer</em>, I&#39;ve worked in Commercial Lending, Heath Care, IoT, and Third Party Logistics, all on an enterprise scale. I love delivering software that has a high ROI. On the current team I lead, keeping the code quality high among myself and fellow developers.</p>
<p><em>As a recording engineer</em>, I&#39;ve worked with a variety of artists (credits listed <a href="/credits">here</a>), from rap to folk to metal. I produced and coached both aspiring songwriters and platinum artists to capture the best possible performances.</p>
<p><em>As a composer</em>, I&#39;ve had my works performed all around the US, including at the Society of Composer&#39;s national conference. I&#39;ve formed bands, wrote music for them, recorded them, toured with them. I like to cater to a performer&#39;s strengths and push those in my compositions.</p>
<p><em>As a familyman</em>, I am happily married with three lovely kiddos.</p>
