I&#39;m a software developer that currently lives in the midwest. I primarily design and build common functionality for the application developers in a global logistics company. I&#39;m married, and have 3 kids and 2 dogs.</p>
<p>This site is for sharing things I have created, or things I&#39;ve learned. As someone who grew up in the Geocities
era, I find a personal web site much more interesting than a social media feed.</p>
<p>I have obsessions with coffee, camping, audio synthesis, and open source software.</p>
<p>In the past, I worked as a audio recording engineer and composer, but after 7 years never quite made it past &quot;barely scraping by&quot;. I still try to find ways to fit that world into my current life.</p>
