### About

I'm a composer and programmer in Kansas City.

#### Background

I got my first bass guitar in 1996. Then formed several bands, cut some records, and toured the US a few times.

After earning a B.M., I recorded music for seven years. I continued writing, and my works were performed and awarded at conferences across the US. I was the only composer at the Society of Composer's 2010 National Conference that had two compositions featured.

Eventually I was burnt-out on recording and obsessed with programming. I got my first gig at a .NET shop, then moved on to javascript-heavy applications.
