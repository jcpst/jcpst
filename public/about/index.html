<p>I&#39;m a composer and programmer in Kansas City.</p>
<h4 id="background-braggadocio">Background / Braggadocio</h4>
<p>I got my first bass guitar in 1996. Then formed bands, cut records, and toured
the US a few times. I earned a B.M. and wrote music that was featured at the
Society of Composer&#39;s national conference. After college, I recorded music for
seven years, everything from the Avett Bros to Gillie Da Kid.</p>
<p>I started burning-out on recording and became obsessed with programming. These
days I&#39;m working as a consultant. I like node, functional programming, shell 
scripting, and Arch Linux.</p>
