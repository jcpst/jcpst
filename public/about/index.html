### About

I'm a composer and programmer in Kansas City.

#### Background

I got my first bass guitar in 1996. Then formed bands, cut records, and toured the US a few times. I earned a B.M. and wrote music that was featured at the Society of Composer's national conference. After college, I recorded music for seven years, everything from the Avett Bros to Gillie Da Kid.

Eventually I burnt-out on recording and became obsessed with programming. These days I develop full-time and enjoy it more than recording. I'm into linux, node, and currently I'm exploring dev ops.
