### About

I'm a composer and software consultant in Kansas City.

#### Background

I got my first bass guitar in 1996. Then formed several bands, cut records for international labels, and toured the US a few times.

After graduating with a B.M., I recorded professionally for seven years ([credits](http://jcpst.com/credits)). I continued writing, and my compositions were performed and awarded at several conferences across the country. I was the only person at the Society of Composer's 2010 National Conference that had two compositions featured.

Eventually I was burnt-out on recording and obsessed with programming. I got my first job at a .NET shop, then moved on to consulting and javascript-heavy applications. I wiped out my last copy of Windows and now use Arch Linux ([some apps I like](http://jcpst.com/software)). It has been very liberting as I dive deeper into the open-source world.
