### About

I'm a composer and programmer in Kansas City.

#### Background

I got my first bass guitar in 1996. Then formed bands, cut records, and toured the US a few times. I earned a B.M., wrote 'art' music that was featured and awarded at various events, including the SCI national conference.

After college, I recorded music for seven years. Eventually I burnt-out on recording and became obsessed with programming. Now I'm a consultant mainly working on various enterprise javascript-heavy applications.
