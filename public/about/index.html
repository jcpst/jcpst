### About

I'm a composer and programmer in Kansas City.

#### Background

I got my first bass guitar in 1996. Then formed several bands, cut records for international labels, and toured the US a few times.

After graduating with a B.M., I recorded professionally for seven years ([credits](http://jcpst.com/credits)). I continued writing, and my works were performed and awarded at conferences across the US. I was the only composer at the Society of Composer's 2010 National Conference that had two compositions featured.

Eventually I was burnt-out on recording and obsessed with programming. I got my first gig at a .NET shop, then moved on to consulting and javascript-heavy applications. I ditched Windows and use Arch Linux these days ([some apps I like](http://jcpst.com/software)).
