I love delivering software that meets business needs, while at the same time keeping the code quality high among myself and fellow developers. </p> <p> <em>As a recording engineer</em>, I've worked with a variety of artists (credits listed <a href=/credits>here</a>), from rap to folk to metal. I produced and coached both aspiring songwriters and platinum artists to capture the best possible performances. </p> <p> <em>As a composer</em>, I've had my works performed all around the US, including at the Society of Composer's national conference. I've formed bands, wrote music for them, recorded them, toured with them. I like to cater to a performer's strengths and push those in my compositions. </p> <p> <em>As a familyman</em>, I am happily married with three lovely kiddos. </p> </main> </div> <div class=w3-rest></div> </div> <br> <br></div> <script>__SAPPER__={baseUrl:""},"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.register("/service-worker.js")</script><script src=/client/a36d94aab44a5c3954b5/main.js></script>
