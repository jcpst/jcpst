<p>Hello. I&#39;m a software developer that currently lives in the midwest. Prior to that,
I worked as a recording engineer. I have 3 kids, 2 dogs, and one wife. </p>
<p>The goal with this site is to share things I&#39;ve learned, or things I&#39;ve created. I have a
distain for modern social media. I&#39;m interested in others that publish their own sites.</p>

<p>Things I&#39;ve been working on since my last update: brewing coffee, experimenting with sampling and sequencing hardware and software.</p>

<p>I wanted to parse <code>.org</code> files for this site, so I made a jsTransformer module: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jstransformer-org">link</a></p>
<h3 id="2020-07-20">2020-07-20</h3>
<p>Decided it was time to redo this site. I wanted to see how little styling I could use without my wife thinking the page looks &quot;broken&quot;.</p>
