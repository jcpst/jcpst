<p>Whether it&#39;s guiding a team of developers to build enterprise-grade software, composing music collaboratively with a group of musicians, or coaching performers in a recording studio, I&#39;m at my best when I&#39;m with people willing to take direction and have two-way communication.</p>
<p>As a software developer I&#39;ve worked in Commercial Lending, Heath Care, Home Automation, Commercial Building Automation, and Third Party Logistics, on a wide variety of technologies and architectures.</p>
<p>As a recording engineer I&#39;ve worked with a variety of artists, in both genre and success (credits listed <a href="/credits">here</a>). I composed hundreds of songs on-the-fly, and produced and coached artists to get the best possible performances on tape.</p>
<p>As a composer, I&#39;ve have my works performed all around the US, including at the Society of Composer&#39;s national conference. I&#39;ve formed bands, wrote music for them, recorded them, toured with them. I like to cater to a performer&#39;s strengths and push those in my compositions.</p>
