        A few months back I participated in the 2022 <a href="https://www.rpmchallenge.com/faq">RPM Challenge</a>.
        I wrote 10 songs, start-to-finish, within the month of February. The best part of it was
        getting out of a rut of starting a composition and never finishing it.

        I make no claims about the greatness of the work, but I do think some interesting ideas were 
        expressed, especially the acoustic bits and field recordings. A few tracks are cleary me just 
        trying to get to the 10 song mark before the end of the month. You can listen to the 
        recordings <a href="https://alonetone.com/jcpst/playlists/rpm-2022">here</a>.

    I wanted to parse `.org` files for this site, so I made a jsTransformer module: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jstransformer-org">link</a>

    Decided it was time to redo this site. I wanted to see how little styling I could use without my wife thinking the page looks "broken".
