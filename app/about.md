### About

I'm a composer and programmer in Kansas City.

#### Background / Braggadocio

I got my first bass guitar in 1996. Then formed bands, cut records, and toured
the US a few times. I earned a B.M. and wrote music that was featured at the
Society of Composer's national conference. After college, I recorded music for
seven years, everything from the Avett Bros to Gillie Da Kid ([credits][]).

I started burning-out on recording and became obsessed with programming. These
days I'm working as a consultant. I like Arch Linux, beer, build/deployment 
automation, functional programming, guitars, just intonation, node, shell 
scripting, and vegan cooking, among other things.
