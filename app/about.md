### About

I'm a composer and programmer in Kansas City.

#### Background / Braggadocio

I picked up my first bass guitar in 1996. Then formed bands, cut records, and 
toured the US a few times. I earned a B.M. and wrote music that was featured at 
the Society of Composer's national conference. After college, I recorded music 
for seven years, everything from the Avett Bros to Gillie Da Kid ([credits][]).

These days I'm working as a programmer/consultant, mainly solving problems on the 
enterprise. Most of what I've done so far has been in Financial/Revenue and IoT.

I'm still composing, performing, getting my works performed, and mixing albums 
for a few clients. I also code up ideas for music-related data-driven web 
applications, raise kids, and love my wife.

My interests include analog synthesizers, Arch Linux, Bash, CI, cycling, functional 
programming, guitars, IPAs, just intonation, node.js, vegan cooking, and walking around.

Holler if you think we should connect.
