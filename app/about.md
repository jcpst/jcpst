### About

I'm a composer and programmer in Kansas City.

#### Background / Braggadocio

I got my first bass guitar in 1996. Then formed bands, cut records, and toured
the US a few times. I earned a B.M. and wrote music that was featured at the
Society of Composer's national conference. After college, I recorded music for
seven years, everything from the Avett Bros to Gillie Da Kid ([credits][]).

I started burning-out on recording and became obsessed with programming. These
days I'm working as a programmer/consultant.

I like analog synthesizers, Arch Linux, Bash, build/deployment automation, 
functional programming, guitars, IPAs, just intonation, node.js, and vegan 
cooking, among other things.
