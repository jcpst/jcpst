### About

I'm a composer and programmer in Kansas City.

#### Background / Braggadocio

I got my first bass guitar in 1996. Then formed bands, cut records, and toured the US a few times. I earned a B.M. and wrote music that was featured at the Society of Composer's national conference. After college, I recorded music for seven years, everything from the Avett Bros to Gillie Da Kid.

I started burning-out on music and became obsessed with programming. These days I'm working as a consultant, mostly writing javascript and bash. My main OS is Arch Linux.
