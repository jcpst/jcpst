Hello, welcome to my home on the web!
</p>
<p>
Like anyone else, I play many different roles in life:
</p>
<p>
<em>As a software developer</em>, I've worked in Commercial Lending, Heath Care, IoT, and Third Party Logistics, all on an enterprise scale. I love delivering software that meets business needs, while at the same time keeping the code quality high among myself and fellow developers.
</p>
<p>
<em>As a recording engineer</em>, I've worked with a variety of artists (credits listed <a href="/credits">here</a>), from rap to folk to metal. I produced and coached both aspiring songwriters and platinum artists to capture the best possible performances.
</p>
<p>
<em>As a composer</em>, I've had my works performed all around the US, including at the Society of Composer's national conference. I've formed bands, wrote music for them, recorded them, toured with them. I like to cater to a performer's strengths and push those in my compositions.
</p>
<p>
<em>As a familyman</em>, I am happily married with three lovely kiddos.
